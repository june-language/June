# June Roadmap

As the language grows, more items may be added.

## General

- [ ] Starting work on a VM (including direct bytecode and file-loaded bytecode)
  - [ ] Dynamic Typing
  - [ ] Static Typing
  - [ ] Optional Typing (`any` types as well as static types)
- [ ] Official language compiler
- [ ] Standard Library
  - [ ] Maybe move to another repository/organisation
- [ ] Language REPL

## Other

These ideas are going to be debated on as they may have larger implications due to language growth and available resources.

- [ ] Package Manager

## Non-goals

These ideas are non-goals. I *might* do these but I probably won't.

- [ ] Rust re-write (debatable)
